## **RISC-V Processor Design (Verilog)**



### **1. INTRODUCTION TO RISC-V PROCESSOR**

---
This project implements a **RISC-V processor** using **Verilog HDL**. RISC-V is an open-source Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture designed for simplicity and efficiency.

The project demonstrates the core components of a RISC-V processor, including instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and write-back.

It is intended for learning computer architecture, processor design, and Verilog simulation.
